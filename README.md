# TinyDrive

TinyDrive is a digital currency project farmed through USB Flash drives, and is designed to make proof of space accessible to everyone. We’ve built it with an artificial reward cap to ensure fair participation in the reward system. Since TinyDrive is implemented entirely in Python, it’s easy for us to access and modify the source code, and we encourage others to do the same.

We’re particularly excited about TinyDrive because it’s ideal for those of us with spare USB drives or anyone who loves exploring new technology. Additionally, TinyDrive is eco-friendly—by using low-powered USB drives, we’re reducing our environmental impact while maintaining the system's security and functionality. For us, it’s all about merging innovation with sustainability in a fun and engaging way.
