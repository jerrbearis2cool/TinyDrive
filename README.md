# TinyDrive

TinyDrive is a (centralized) digital currency aimed to bring proof of space to everyone, rewards are artificially limited to allow everyone to participate in the reward system fairly. TinyDrive consists of 100% python enabling easy access and modifications to the source code, that's right, TinyDrive is open source in GitHub. This project is aimed at those with extra USB drives laying around, or at those who love to have fun!

How does plotting work?


Plotting for TinyDrive happens in 6 lines of code by generating a 4 GB file 8 bytes at a time using a seed. This is where the beauty comes in because plot files are so easily generated, 4 GB is not the minimum plot size needed for farming (the theoretical minimum is 1 MB, but most of the work would be rejected) because the chunk taken from the plot as work is 1 MB.

How does farming work?

The farmer requests work, which is a random chunk (index) of the winning plot taken and hashed, everyone receives different indexes to prevent copied homework.

Nothing too complicated!!!
