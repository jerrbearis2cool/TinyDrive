# TinyDrive

TinyDrive is a (centralized) digital currency aimed to bring proof of space and proof of work to everyone, rewards are artificially limited to allow everyone to participate in the reward system fairly. TinyDrive consists of 100% python enabling easy access and modifications to the source code, that's right, TinyDrive is open source on GitHub. This project is aimed at those with extra USB drives laying around, or at those who love to have fun!

Not only is tiny drive a great proof-of-space concept, those who secure the network by verifying submitted plot files get rewarded through low energy ram intensive hashing, the large ram capacity needed for the hashing process can eliminate all attempts at making asic miners.

The hashing method in question is SHAKE-128, an XOF hashing algorithm allowing an extended output, the perfect method for generating plot files.
